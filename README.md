# Neon Estate

Neon Estate is a messaging app that I'm building for fun and to keep myself up to date on React and Typescript standards.

## What does the name mean?

Neon Estate is both a reference to the fifth estate of journalism in the larger zeitgeist of our modern society and a reflection of the impact of capitalism on the expression of free speech online.
Jk, it's literally just two words picked out of a hat, like all great web apps.

## How to Run Locally
